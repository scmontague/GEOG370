<h1>Homework 8: Vector Geospatial Analysis for Floodplains and Schools withing 5 km of Municipal Solid Waste Landfills</h1>

<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>This project uses vector geoprocessing analysis to answer the following real-world question: How many public schools are within 5 kilometers of a municipal solid waste landfill?</p>

<!-- Pre-work Discussion -->
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A study found that living within 5 kilometers of a MSW landfill correlates with a higher change of dying from lung cancer and other respiratory disease. This is believed to be because of increased amounts of H2S in the air.</p><br>

<!-- Discussion of methods and presentation of results -->
<h2>Making the Map</h2>
<p>I got data for all landfills in North Carolina and filtered the data to only display landfills that contained municipal solid waste and that were in Mecklenburg County. I made a 5000 meter buffer around these points. I then added data for public schools and the floodplains in Mecklenburg county and interesected them with the buffer I made. </p><br>
