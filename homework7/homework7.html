<h1>Homework 7: California Air Quality Index</h1>
<p1>I chose to make a map about Air Quality in California because California has many different things causing air pollution such as smog and forrest fires. California is a very  large state geographically, this is part of the reason I made my map about California. The different geography of the State and the different population density around the state means there is a large range of median AQI values. I used the natural breaks categorization to make this chloropleth. </p1>
